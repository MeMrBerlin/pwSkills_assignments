    "1. **Resource Management**: It limits the number of active processes to avoid overloading system resources like CPU and memory.\n",
    "2. **Task Distribution**: Tasks are assigned to available processes in the pool, which helps in balancing the workload efficiently.\n",
    "3. **Reusability**: Processes in the pool are reused for different tasks, reducing the overhead of creating and destroying processes repeatedly.\n",
